# project-nimitz
Unity port of Victory Point Games board game, Carrier (1990).
Code is currently on UnityCloud - if there is interest I will migrate to GitHub.

This project will try to be a 100% accurate port of the board game.
This project will also try to be moddable to some extent, for players who wish to explore alternative rules to the game.

Assets used are from vassal Carrier game, improved spritesheets are welcome

This is completely free, open source, non commercial,  etc etc *Placeholder for legal stuff*

Some in game screenshots for now, most status is in the Project Board under Tasks.
